# Lab 5 - Administering Your Customer’s Managed Applications

This lab will take you through the process of administering Managed Applications your customer has purchased from you. When you are done you will have a feel for what it means to work with your customer's installed applications as a publisher.

## Exercise 1 - Introducing Managed Application Center

This exercise introduces the primary tool you will use for administering your customer's installations of your solution, **Managed Applications Center**. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box at the top of the page, enter **Managed Applications Center** and select it from the dropdown.
   > 🗒️ Note this page allows access to tools to manage both **Service Catalog-based** applications and **Marketplace applications**.
2. In the left hand menu, select **Browse > Marketplace applications**. You see a list of all the offers that have been purchased by your customers.
3. Click the link **AMA Workshop 01**.
4. Here you see a list of all customer purchases of your marketplace Managed Applications.

## Exercise 2 - Working in your customer's Managed Resource Group

Now you will perform some "maintenance" of your customer's solution in their Managed Resource Group.

1. Next to the **workshopapp2** Application name, click the link **workshopapp2-mrg** to the Managed Resource Group.
2. Viewing the managed resource group contents, you see all the resources that were created by the ARM template.

### Managing a Virtual Machine

1. Click the link to the virtual machine.

2. Find the **Storage account** and select the checkbox next to it. 
3. In the top menu, click the **Delete** button.
4. Type **delete** to confirm and then the **Delete** button at the bottom of the page.
   > Because you are the owner of the Managed Application, the storage account is deleted.

### Adding Resources

2. Click the **Create** button on the top of the page.
3. Type **storage account** in the search box.

1. Open the **Managed Applications Center**.
2. Go to **Marketplace applications**.
