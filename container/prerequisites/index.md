# Lab prerequisites

There are several must-have and some nice-to-have prerequisites for completing the labs in the Mastering Container Offers course.

## Accounts

To complete these labs you will need the following accounts.

- An Azure account to be used to create resources through the Azure portal
- A Partner Center account wherein you can create offers

## Software

The following software is also needed to complete set labs. The below steps walk you through setting up these software prerequisites.

1. [An Azure Container Registry](./acr.md)
2. [An Azure Kubernetes Service instance](./aks.md)
3. [Docker Desktop](./docker.md)
4. For Windows users, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) must be installed. See [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install it.
5. You'll spend a lot of time on the command line in these labs. For Windows users we **recommend** [installing Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) as it gives a great terminal experience on Windows.
6. A text editor of your choice. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for any platform.

Once you have completed these prerequisites, go back to the [Container Offer labs home page](../index.md) and proceed to the first lab.

1. Docker
2. Helm
3. ARM templates
4. Azure Container Registry
5. Kubernetes
6. Linux command line
