# SaaS Accelerator

The SaaS Accelerator provides a fully functional community-led SaaS reference implementation for those interested in publishing transactable SaaS offers in Microsoft's marketplace in hours instead of days. This series of video modules and hands-on labs is designed to help you understand, install, use, and customize the [SaaS Accelerator](https://aka.ms/SaaSAccelerator) project.

## Labs
Your SaaS Offer can be deployed and published in just a few steps using the SaaS Accelerator

>Note: You will need to complete these labs in the order they are provided to ensure continuity

1. If you have completed Partner Center setup of the offer, follow [Path 1](./Path-1/README.md) 
1. If you are creating your offer from scratch and don't have an offer on Partner center yet, follow [Path 2](./Path-2/README.md)
